Compare the statistics of the two different corpora â€“ What are the differences in
the most common unigrams between the two? What interestingthings do you see about the bigrams?

    The most common unigrams in both documents were words like 'the'. In both documents, the 10 most frequent words
    are 'the', 'of', 'to', 'a', 'and', 'in', 'that', 'says', 'is', and 'for', (different order, but same words).
    If you look further there are some interesting frequent words. Below are some frequent words I
    thought were interesting from each document.

        Rural:
            28. australia 1139
            31. farmers 1085
            36. water 907
            40. growers 817
            42. industry 801
            43. south 782
            45. government 748

        Science:
            37. researchers 1008
            42. research 899
            47. university 854
            53. study 966
            54. scientists 731
            63. dr. 630

    I think the frequent bigrams are more interesting. Below are some examples.

        Rural:
            10. per cent 555
            16. the federal 388
            18. new south 375
            19. south wales 374
            21. the australian 343
            25. federal government 284
            39. the national 212 

        Science:
            11. the researchers 529
            14. university of 489
            16. the university 414
            22. the journal 334
            31. the study 283
            45. researchers say 219
            52. the scientists

    The most common words are pretty obvious. The rural news talks about farming while the scientific news talks about research
    and universities. What I found interesting was how much more the rural news talks about Australia. Words like "Australia",
    "federal", and "government" are very common. It would make sense that rural news would cover more about domestic issues,
    so phrases about the Australian federal government would more likely come from a rural news article. The scientific news
    talks more about research, scientists, and journals.

    Several of the common bigrams are clearly parts of what are also common trigrams. In the rural document, for example,
    'new south' and 'south wales' combine as 'new south wales', a state in Australia with strong agricultural production.
    Similarly, 'the federal' and 'federal government' combine as 'the federal government'. In the scientific article,
    'the university' and 'university of' combine as 'the university of'.

    I also found it interesting that 'per cent' occurred so often in the rural news document but not in the scientific news
    document. (A quick cmd+f revealed that '%', 'percent', and 'per cent' occur about 430 times total in the science doc,
    which is still less than 'per cent' in the rural doc.)


Choose a sentence (fragment) from your first corpus and a sentence (fragment) of the same length from your second corpus.
Using Add-1 Smoothing, compute the probabilities of the 2 different sentences on each corpus.
What do you find?  Explain the results.

    Sentences:
        Rural:
            "A small number of Western Australian bananas have been sent to the eastern states after a sharp drop in demand."
            
            "The long paddock is getting crowded around Narrabri, in north-west New South Wales,
            where 25,000 head of livestock are searching for feed on the stock routes."

        Scientific:
            "Dr Bernd Irlenbusch of the London School of Economics adds he was surprised with the extent of punishment."

            "Australians are in a prime position to see Mercury moving across the Sun this week, an event they won't be
            able to see again for another 26 years."


    I chose 4 different sentences to test, and my program classified them all correctly. I chose two pairs of sentences of similar
    length where both pairs had a sentence from both documents. From the rural news document, I chose one sentence about
    Australian bananas and one about a paddock in New South Wales, both of which had significantly higher probabilities of
    being in the rural document. From the scientific news document, my first sentence was about a researcher at the London 
    school of economics, which was easily classified as from the science document. I thought I could trick my program with
    the second sentence from the scientific document because of 1) how vaguely scientific it is, and 2) how frequently Australia
    is mentioned in the rural news document, but it ended up finding the scentence slightly more probable in the scientific
    news article.
